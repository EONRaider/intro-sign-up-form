## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet.

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

* This project took me a few more hours than expected to complete when it came to JavaScript. I wanted to make use of
  the opportunity to try more complex code than I got used to in these humble 3 weeks of frontend development
  experience.
  This time I managed to use ES6 classes syntax along with inheritance and polymorphism to make the code as re-usable as
  possible.
* Seeing how clumsy it is to implement an abstract base class in JavaScript I decided to take a look into TypeScript for
  my next projects. This will be a good addition to my skill set.
